"""Witcher 3 Script Merger merge-inventory preservation.

Script Merger records every merge it creates in MergeInventory.xml next to
its own exe (Applications/ScriptMerger/).  That file is the merger's ONLY
record of existing merges — the merged files in the game folder are just
output, never rescanned.  On every launch the merger validates each entry
and offers to delete entries whose merged file or source-mod files are
missing from the deployed game folder, so running it while the source mods
are disabled wipes the records even though the manager preserves the merged
files themselves (the Merged_Mods staging mod).

This module pairs the inventory with the Merged_Mods staging mod:

- ``snapshot_inventory``: after a merger run (once ``game.restore()`` has
  rescued the merged files), record the app-dir inventory into the
  profile's Merged_Mods folder as ``.mm_merge_inventory.xml`` (excluded
  from deploy).  Merged, not copied verbatim: a run whose source mods were
  disabled wipes the app-dir records as collateral, so prior snapshot
  entries are kept as long as their merged output still exists in staging.
- ``restore_inventory``: before a merger launch, copy the profile's
  snapshot back into the app dir.  This also makes merges per-profile —
  the app dir is shared across profiles, the snapshot is not.
- ``missing_merge_sources``: parse the inventory and report merges whose
  source mods (or the merged mod itself) are not currently deployed, so
  the wizard can warn before the merger deletes those records.
