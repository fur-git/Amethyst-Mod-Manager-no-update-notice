"""
collection_export.py
Build a Vortex/Nexus-compatible collection archive (.7z) from export rows.

The manifest format mirrors real Vortex collections (see a published
collection.json): top-level ``info`` / ``mods`` / ``modRules`` /
``plugins`` / ``pluginRules`` / ``collectionConfig``. The archive layout is
``collection.json`` + ``bundled/<archive>`` for bundle-source mods, plus an
``Amethyst/`` folder carrying the source profile's exact modlist + portable
state (ignored by Vortex, applied by our installer - see
_amethyst_state_jobs). Our own collection installer consumes exactly this
shape, so exports round-trip.

Rows come from ``profile_export.load_rows`` plus the per-row UI flags
(source / direct_url / optional / fomod_export). All functions are
toolkit-free; the Qt view drives them from a worker thread.

    a few-KB manifest and badly wrong for a multi-GB bundle. Measured on this
    machine over 96 MB, LZMA2 spends ~33s regardless of preset (1 and 7 land
    within a second of each other and produce the same size), because the cost
    is dominated by pushing already-compressed bytes through the coder - so
    dropping the preset alone buys nothing. Storing the same payload takes
    0.2s: ~190x faster.

    So the choice is made on what the payload actually is. Bundles are tool
    output - DynDOLOD LOD, BC-compressed DDS, packed BSAs - which compression
    cannot shrink, and storing those turns hours into seconds. A bundle that
    does compress (loose meshes, plugins, configs) is still worth compressing,
    because archive size counts against the single-upload limit; that case
    packs at preset 1, which matches preset 7's ratio here for less work.

    Stays on LZMA2/copy deliberately. ZSTD packs faster still, but official
    7-Zip - and so Vortex's node-7z, and our own py7zr readers - cannot extract
    a zstd-compressed .7z, and the archive has to open everywhere.
