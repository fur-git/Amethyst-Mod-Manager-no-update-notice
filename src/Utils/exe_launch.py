"""
Toolkit-neutral executable launch logic for the play bar.

Ports the persistence + launch dispatch out of the Tk exe launcher
(gui/plugin_panel_exe_launcher.py, gui/dialogs.py, wizards/_proton_prefix.py)
so the Qt GUI can use it without importing tkinter. File formats and paths are
identical to the Tk app so settings are shared between both:

- <staging>.parent/Applications/custom_exes.json        - manual exe list
- ~/.config/AmethystModManager/games/<game>/exe_launch_mode.json
      exe_name → "auto"|"steam"|"heroic"|"none"
      "__deploy_before_launch" → bool (default True)
      "__proton_override_<exe>" → Proton dir name ('' = game default)
      "__launch_options_<exe>" → Steam-style launch options string
      "__hidden_auto_exes" → [exe names] hidden auto-detected framework exes
- exe_args.json (global, or per-profile for profile-specific-mods profiles)
      exe_name → argument string

Launch entry points (launch_game / launch_exe_via_proton) are synchronous and
must be called from a worker thread; they only report through log_fn.

    Inside a Flatpak sandbox the runtime has no `steam` binary and its own
    xdg-open can't resolve steam:// URLs, so we must forward to the host via
    ``flatpak-spawn --host``. A bare ``subprocess.Popen`` of that command
    "succeeds" (it finds flatpak-spawn) even when the *host* side fails -
    wrong host CWD, missing binary - which is why the Play button silently
    did nothing. ``spawn_watched`` fixes the CWD, watches the real exit code,
    and chains to the next candidate on failure.

    *extra_args* are forwarded to the game's command line. Two forms, tried
    in this order when args are present:
      1. ``steam -applaunch <id> <args>`` - the documented CLI form, Steam
         reliably appends the args (after the user's Launch Options).
      2. the rungameid URL with args after ``//`` ('+'-separated, URL-quoted)
         - best-effort: some Steam builds ignore URL args, but it's the only
         route into a Flatpak Steam (no host ``steam`` binary). xdg-open
         exits 0 once the URL is handed off, so a dropped arg can't be
         detected - which is why it must come *after* -applaunch here,
         reversing the argless candidate order.

    A non-Steam shortcut is addressed differently: rungameid wants the 64-bit
    composite id built from the shortcut's app id, and ``-applaunch`` doesn't
    accept shortcuts at all (it only resolves real store app ids), so that

    some users report Steam Input still swapping to the game's controller
    profile - locking the trackpad/OSK out of the tool's UI - even with

    helper mirrors that launch byte-for-byte (env from ``os.environ`` + \
WINEPREFIX + Proton's bin on PATH, ``wine start.exe <exe>``), with only two
    deviations: ``/wait`` so the wizard flow can block until the tool exits,
    and ``/unix`` in place of winetricks' winepath round-trip.
