"""Global download bandwidth limiter (toolkit-neutral).

A single token-bucket shared by EVERY download thread in the app — the
collection installer's parallel workers, single nxm/Downloads-tab downloads
and the collection-archive fetch all call :func:`throttle` from their
streaming loops, so the configured cap applies to the aggregate transfer
rate, not per-connection.

Throttling works by sleeping between socket reads: requests' ``iter_content``
only pulls from the socket when the loop asks for the next chunk, so pausing
the consumer applies TCP backpressure and genuinely slows the sender.

The limit is persisted in amethyst.ini (see ``Utils.ui_config``) and loaded
lazily on first use; the UI applies changes live via :func:`set_limit_mbps`
(0 = unlimited).
