    deploy_dir     - destination directory (e.g. <game_path>/Data)
    staging_root   - Profiles/<game>/mods/
    mode           - transfer method
    strip_prefixes - same set passed to build_filemap; used to locate source
                     files whose leading folder was stripped from the filemap
                     path (e.g. rel_str "Nautilus/Nautilus.dll" may live on
                     disk as "plugins/Nautilus/Nautilus.dll").
    per_mod_strip_prefixes - optional dict mapping mod name to list of
                     top-level folder names to prepend when resolving (user-
                     configured "ignore" folders for that mod).
    progress_fn    - optional callable(done: int, total: int, phase: str)
                     reporting one combined preparation + transfer counter.
                     Legacy two-argument callbacks remain supported.
    flatten_extensions - lowercase extensions whose files are placed flat at
                     the top of the deploy dir (basename only), regardless of
                     their staging subfolder.  BG3 passes {".pak"} because the
                     game only loads paks at the top level of the Mods folder.
    per_mod_subdirs - optional mapping of mod name to one destination folder
                     below deploy_dir.  Applied only to the normal deploy_dir,
                     never separator/custom destinations.  BepInEx uses this
                     to isolate Thunderstore plugins below their versionless
                     package ID, matching r2modman's package layout.
    path_remap     - optional destination-only path-prefix replacements. Source
                     lookup always uses the original filemap path. This is the
                     standard-directory equivalent of deploy_filemap_to_root's
                     remapping support.
    replace_existing - unlink regular files/symlinks already present at normal
                     deploy destinations before transfer. Private VFS layer
                     construction uses this to preserve physical deploy's
                     ordering when an earlier custom route and a later normal
                     or remapped entry converge on one destination.
    source_resolver - optional handler callback for filemaps whose displayed
                     destination differs from the staged source layout. It is
                     called with keyword arguments ``staging_root``,
                     ``mod_name``, ``relative``, ``strip_prefixes``,
                     ``overwrite_dir``, and ``cache``. The normal resolver is
                     unchanged when this is omitted.

    Returns:
        (count, placed_lower)
        placed_lower is the set of lowercased rel paths successfully placed -
        pass it to deploy_core() so it can skip files already provided by mods.
