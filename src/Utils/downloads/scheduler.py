    Root problem this solves: with a single fetch-link→download loop per worker,
    every worker blocks on a ``get_download_links`` round-trip between mods. For
    tiny archives that latency is comparable to the download itself and all the
    workers hit it in lockstep, so the pipe stutters - downloads arrive at the
    installer in bursts of *dl_workers* with idle gaps between. Pipelining the
    link fetch hides that latency behind other in-flight downloads. Reserving a
    lane for the largest remaining archives also overlaps that small-file churn
    with a long transfer that can keep the connection busy.

    *mods*        - PRE-SORTED smallest→largest (see :func:`order_by_size`).
    *fetch*       - ``fetch(mod) -> links``, called on a link-worker thread;
                    whatever it returns is passed straight to *download* as-is
                    (return None/[] to let *download* fetch links itself). May
                    raise - the mod still flows to *download* with ``links=None``
                    so the caller's per-mod bookkeeping (counters, install-queue
                    sentinels) still fires exactly once.
    *download*    - ``download(mod, links)``, called on a download-worker thread
                    once per mod, exactly once. May raise - the exception is
                    swallowed so the worker (and the pipeline) keeps flowing.
    *dl_workers*  - number of download-worker threads (>=1).
    *link_workers*- number of link-fetch threads (>=1) available across both
                    lanes.
    *large_workers* - download lanes reserved for the largest remaining mods.
    *large_download* - optional callback for items downloaded by those lanes.
    *strict_order* - publish prefetched items to each download lane in claim
                    order, even when concurrent link fetches finish out of order.
    *size_key*    - identify unknown sizes at the end, claimed after known sizes.
    *stop*        - optional cancel event; when set, both stages drain the
                    remainder (feeding *download* with ``links=None``) so every
                    mod is still handed off once and the caller short-circuits.
    *worker_done* - optional cleanup called once on each download-worker thread.
    *spawn*       - optional ``spawn(target, name) -> thread-like`` for tests.

    Each lane has a bounded ready queue so links are only minted a little ahead
    of consumption. The small and large fetchers share one double-ended cursor,
    guaranteeing that each mod is claimed exactly once.
