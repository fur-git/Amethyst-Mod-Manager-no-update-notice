"""
Wizard-tool category grouping (GUI-neutral).

Shared by the Tk wizard picker (gui/wizard_dialog.py) and the Qt Wizards
header menu.  A tool may declare its own ``category`` on its WizardTool; if
it doesn't, one is inferred from its id below.  ``CATEGORY_ORDER`` fixes the
display order of the headers; anything not listed falls under "Other" at the
bottom.
