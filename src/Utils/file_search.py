"""Shared search-query parsing for the file-tree search boxes (Mod Files, Text
Files, Data tabs).

These boxes filter a flat list of file paths, so the only useful `!token` is a
FILETYPE filter — `!.dds` (or the bare `!dds`, normalised to a leading dot).
Everything else in the query is a plain-text needle matched against the path.

`parse_file_query` splits a raw query into `(needle, exts)`:
  - `needle`   lowercased plain-text substring (may be "")
  - `exts`     frozenset of lowercased extensions WITH a leading dot (may be empty)

Multiple `!` tokens accumulate (OR — a file matches if its extension is any of
them), and the needle ANDs with the extension set — mirroring the modlist token
search convention. Callers keep a file when:
    (not exts   or  Path(path).suffix.lower() in exts)
    and (not needle  or  needle in <path/其他 haystack>)
