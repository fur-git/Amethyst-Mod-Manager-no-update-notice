    ----------
    log_fn / progress_fn

    root_folder_enabled
        Honors the Mod List panel's Root_Folder toggle; always True off the GUI.
    confirm_cet
        Optional blocking confirmation prompt (Cyberpunk CET symlink check).
        Return False to abort the deploy. None means "always proceed".
    confirm_windows_fs
        Optional blocking advisory when deploy folders sit on a Windows
        filesystem (NTFS/exFAT - see Utils.fs_check; GH#307). Called before
        any state is touched, so returning False is a clean no-op cancel.

    confirm_downgrade
        Optional blocking advisory when Fallout 3's exe is the Anniversary
        build FOSE cannot load (see Utils.fo3_version_check). Called before any
        state is touched, so returning False is a clean no-op cancel - the GUI
        returns False when the user opts to open the Downgrade wizard instead.
        None means "always proceed".
    do_backup
        If True, run `create_backup` for the profile dir before deploy.
    on_pre_filemap
        Optional hook fired *after* the profile switch but *before* the
        filemap rebuild. Used by wizards (e.g. BodySlide output redirect)
        to materialize a placeholder mod that needs to be in the filemap.

    Returns True on success, False on user-cancel / error. The active profile
    is always reset to *profile* before returning, even on error.
