"""
modlist.py
Read and write a MO2-compatible modlist.txt file.

Format (one mod per line):
  +ModName          — enabled mod
  -ModName          — disabled mod
  *ModName          — enabled, always-on (cannot be toggled)
  +Name_separator   — separator (MO2 sometimes writes these with +)
  -Name_separator   — separator (canonical form, written with - prefix)

Priority: line 0 (top) = highest priority, last line = priority 0.
Separators do not count toward priority numbering.
