"""Track whether a Play click actually got a process running.

A launch can fail in a dozen places - no Proton found, no
Steam/Heroic/Lutris/Faugus route matched, the xdg-open handler chain
exhausted, the spawned process dying
instantly - and several of them only find out from a watcher thread long after
the launch call returned. Rather than thread a callback through every one of
those paths, the Play handler opens a report for the duration of the launch:
the spawn helpers record into the report bound to the calling thread, and late
failures reach the same object through the reference their watcher captured.

Nothing here is Play-specific except who opens the report - with no report
bound (tool launches, wizards, CLI) every call is a no-op.
