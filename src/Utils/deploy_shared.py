    ----------
    backup_dir
        Directory whose tree mirrors *target_root* (or absolute paths, if

    target_root
        Where files are moved back to.  Pass ``Path("/")`` for the
        custom-deploy case where backups mirror absolute filesystem paths.
    label
        Tag used in log messages (defaults to ``backup_dir.name``).  Passed
        through unchanged so callers can keep their existing wording.
    check_traversal
        When True (the default), skip any backup whose reconstructed
        destination would escape *target_root*.  Set False for the
        absolute-path case (custom_deploy_backup), where ``target_root`` is
        the root of the filesystem and the check is meaningless.
    swallow_errors
        When True, catch ``OSError`` per file and log a warning rather than
        propagating. Failed entries and their backup tree remain for retry.
    resolve_dir_case
        Match existing destination directory names case-insensitively.  Root
        deployment uses this on case-sensitive filesystems because deploy
        merges into the game's existing directory casing.

    Returns the number of files restored.

@dataclass
class CustomRule:
    """A file-routing rule that sends matched files to a game-root-relative
    destination directory.

    Matching is by extension, leading folder name, or both (both must match).

    dest       - path relative to the game install root (e.g. "pak_mods", "")
    extensions - lowercase file extensions to match (e.g. [".pak"]).
                 Empty list means no extension filter.
    folders    - path-segment names to match (e.g. ["natives"]).  Matching is
                 case-insensitive, but the casing spelled here is the canonical
                 one: a matched folder deploys under this spelling no matter
                 what casing the mod shipped, so ``~Mods`` and ``~mods`` can't
                 become two folders on a case-sensitive filesystem.
                 Empty list means no folder filter.
    loose_only - when True, the rule only matches files that are not inside
                 any folder (i.e. files at the mod root with no directory
                 components in their relative path).  Default False.
    companion_extensions - lowercase file extensions (e.g. [".ini"]) whose
                 owners ride along with a primary match.  When this rule
                 matches a file, any sibling in the same folder with the same
                 basename stem and one of these extensions is also routed to
                 the same destination.  Used for formats like RDR2's ASI
                 plugins where "Foo.asi" and "Foo.ini" must both live at the
                 game root even though the ``.ini`` extension is too generic
                 to route unconditionally.
    flatten    - when True, folder matches drop all directory components
                 below the matched folder so the file lands flat under
                 ``dest``.  Default False (preserve subfolders, the historical
                 behaviour).
    include_siblings - when True, a single match drags the *containing
                 folder* of the matched file along with it: every sibling
                 file under that folder (from the same mod) is routed to
                 ``dest`` too, preserving its path relative to the
                 containing folder.  ``flatten`` is ignored for these
                 matches; the containing folder's name is kept under
                 ``dest`` so files stay grouped.  Useful for mods like
                 ``PD2-AdvancedCrosshairs/mod.txt`` where matching
                 ``mod.txt`` should also bring the whole mod folder along.
    to_prefix  - when True, ``dest`` is resolved relative to the game's
                 Proton/Wine prefix root (the ``pfx/`` directory) instead
                 of the game install root.  Use for files that belong
                 inside the virtual Windows filesystem (e.g.
                 ``drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/...``).  Requires the
                 caller to pass ``prefix_root`` to ``deploy_custom_rules``;
                 rules with ``to_prefix=True`` are skipped when no prefix
                 is available.
    mirror_dests - additional destination dirs (resolved under the same
                 base as ``dest``) that every matched file is also placed
                 into.  Used for Steam/GOG dual My Games folders where the
                 same save must land in both variants.
    exclude_extensions - lowercase file extensions this rule must NOT claim,
                 even when the folder/filename criteria match.  Used by BG3's
                 ``mods`` folder rule so loose files under Mods/ route to the
                 game Data dir while ``Mods/Foo.pak`` stays with the normal
                 deploy into the Larian AppData Mods folder.

    Placement behaviour:
    - extension-only match: file placed as game_root/dest/<filename> (flat)
    - folder match (with or without extension): file placed as
      game_root/dest/<original rel_path> (full path preserved)
    - filename match: file placed flat as game_root/dest/<filename>
    - companion match: file placed using the same rule as its primary owner
