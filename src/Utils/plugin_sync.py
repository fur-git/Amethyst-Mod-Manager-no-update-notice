"""Sync plugins.txt / loadorder.txt when mods are enabled or disabled.

Disabling a mod removes its top-level plugins from plugins.txt (star games
keep the loadorder.txt entry as position memory); enabling adds missing ones
back at their remembered load-order slot. The whole batch is one
read-modify-write per file. Per-mod plugin spellings come from a compact
Filegraph snapshot query without materialising the complete file list."""
