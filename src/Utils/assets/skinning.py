"""Pose skinned meshes against a skeleton, so a whole actor assembles.

A body is not one mesh. Skyrim builds an actor from separate nifs - head,
body, hands, feet, then whatever armour covers them - and each one's vertices
sit in ITS OWN bones' space, not a shared one. Rendering them raw piles them
on top of each other; placing each by its dominant bone (what Utils.assets.nif
does with no skeleton to hand) is right for a lone FaceGen head but collapses
a body, because feet, hands and torso each normalise into a different bone.

The skeleton is the missing piece. ``skeleton.nif`` holds every bone's world
transform, so a vertex reaches actor space by:

    v_actor = sum over bones( weight_i * BoneWorld_i * Bind_i * v )

Bind_i is the shape's own skin->bone transform (NiSkinData). Rigid shapes -
every FaceGen head part, bound to one bone - need no weights and are placed
whole, which is both cheaper and exactly what the engine does.

This is bind-pose posing, not animation: no controllers are read, so an actor
stands in the skeleton's rest pose.

    such bones out of 17. Dropping them and renormalising onto the one bone
