"""User-configured environment variables for Amethyst itself.

Settings ▸ Advanced ▸ "Edit environment variables…" lets a user pin env vars
that are applied to the app's OWN process at startup - the kill switches and
diagnostics that were previously only reachable by launching from a terminal
with ``AMM_FOO=1 ./Amethyst.AppImage``. This is NOT the per-exe launch options
used for games/tools (those live in Settings ▸ Executables → exe_launch.py).

`apply_saved_env` runs from ``app_bootstrap.setup_environment()``, before any
Qt / Utils import, so Qt-level vars (QT_QPA_PLATFORM, QT_XCB_GL_INTEGRATION)
are in place before the QApplication reads them.

Removal across a re-exec: Settings restarts the app with ``os.execv``, which
inherits the current environment - so simply not re-applying a var the user
deleted would leave the OLD value live. `_MARKER_VAR` records the names we set
last launch; anything listed there but no longer configured is unset.

Escape hatch: ``AMM_NO_ENV_OVERRIDES=1`` in the real shell skips the whole
thing, so a bad value can't lock a user out of the UI that fixes it.
