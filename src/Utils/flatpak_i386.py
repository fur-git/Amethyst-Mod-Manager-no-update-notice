"""
Utils/flatpak_i386.py
Detect and repair missing 32-bit support inside our own Flatpak sandbox.

The Flatpak manifest declares the org.freedesktop.Platform.Compat.i386 (+GL32)
extensions, which provide /lib/ld-linux.so.2 — the 32-bit ELF interpreter
Proton's wine needs when it boots a prefix (syswow64 processes are 32-bit even
for 64-bit games/tools). Flathub installs pull those related refs in
automatically, but installs from a .flatpak *bundle* (our release zip,
Warehouse, `flatpak install file.flatpak`) do NOT — the extension point stays
empty and the runtime's /lib/ld-linux.so.2 symlink dangles. Every in-sandbox
Proton/wine run then dies with "/lib/ld-linux.so.2: could not open".

Two repair surfaces:
  * ``preflight_i386_error`` — called before an in-sandbox Proton run so the
    user gets an actionable message instead of the cryptic loader error.
  * ``install_i386_extensions`` — installs the refs on the host via
    flatpak-spawn (the app startup self-heal in gui_qt.app uses this).

# Extension refs the sandbox needs for 32-bit support. Branches MUST match the
# manifest's add-extensions block in flatpak/io.github.Amethyst.ModManager.yml.
#
# IMPORTANT: the two extensions are branched on DIFFERENT axes:
#   * Compat.i386 tracks the freedesktop base (KDE 6.9 → 24.08). This ref
#     provides /lib/ld-linux.so.2 — the 32-bit ELF interpreter wine needs. It
#     is the ONE that actually matters; without it wine cannot boot at all.
#   * GL32.default tracks the GL driver version (1.4), NOT the freedesktop base.
#     There is no "GL32.default//24.08" ref on Flathub — asking for it fails
#     with "…not installed" / "file doesn't exist". GL32 only supplies 32-bit
#     OpenGL, which most tools (dtkit-patch, vcredist, wine setup) never touch,
#     so a GL32 failure must NOT sink the whole repair.
