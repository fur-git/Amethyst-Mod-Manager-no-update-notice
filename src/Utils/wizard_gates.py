"""
GUI-neutral wizard gating helpers.

Game files decide which wizard tools to offer by probing the install (exe in
staging, dll winning in the filemap). Those probes used to live in the Tk
wizard modules (wizards/bodyslide.py, sse_display_tweaks.py, engine_fixes.py),
which import customtkinter at module level — the Qt app can't import them, so
the neutral copies live here and the game files import from this module.
