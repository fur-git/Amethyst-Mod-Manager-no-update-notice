"""Migrate name-keyed per-mod state when a mod is renamed.

Tkinter-free port of the disk-backed half of gui/modlist_panel.py
`_migrate_mod_name_state` (6618-6690): strip prefixes, disabled plugins,
excluded mod files and mod notes are all keyed by mod name in the profile's
state files — a rename must re-key them or the settings silently detach from
the mod. (modindex.bin migration lives in Utils.filemap.rename_in_mod_index;
the in-memory renderer sets are Tk-only and rebuilt on reload in Qt.)
