"""Double-ended download dispatch for collection installs (toolkit-neutral).

Problem: with N equal download workers all pulling from one size-sorted list,
many tiny archives finish faster than the Nexus API can hand out the next CDN
link, so the queue stutters and bandwidth sits idle until a big mod happens to
land in a slot.

Fix: dedicate ONE worker to the largest-remaining mods (it stays busy on long
transfers that keep the pipe full) and let the other workers burn through the
smallest-remaining mods from the other end. They converge in the middle, so
every mod is dispatched exactly once and the link-fetch latency of the small
mods is hidden behind the big worker's ongoing transfer.

This module only owns the *dispatch order*; the actual per-mod work (link
fetch, download, hand-off to the install queue) is the caller's `work` fn.

    small dedicated pool AHEAD of the download workers, so a download worker
    that just finished a tiny archive finds the next link already waiting and
    starts transferring bytes with ZERO link-fetch latency.

    Root problem this solves: with a single fetch-link→download loop per worker,
    every worker blocks on a ``get_download_links`` round-trip between mods. For
    tiny archives that latency is comparable to the download itself and all the
    workers hit it in lockstep, so the pipe stutters - downloads arrive at the
    installer in bursts of *dl_workers* with idle gaps between. Pipelining the
    link fetch hides that latency behind other in-flight downloads.

    *mods*        - PRE-SORTED smallest→largest (see :func:`order_by_size`);
                    both stages honour that order (fetchers claim from the head).
    *fetch*       - ``fetch(mod) -> links``, called on a link-worker thread;
                    whatever it returns is passed straight to *download* as-is
                    (return None/[] to let *download* fetch links itself). May
                    raise - the mod still flows to *download* with ``links=None``
                    so the caller's per-mod bookkeeping (counters, install-queue
                    sentinels) still fires exactly once.
    *download*    - ``download(mod, links)``, called on a download-worker thread
                    once per mod, exactly once, in the same smallest-first order
                    the fetchers claimed. May raise - the exception is swallowed
                    so the worker (and the pipeline) keeps flowing.
    *dl_workers*  - number of download-worker threads (>=1).
    *link_workers*- number of link-fetch threads (>=1). Small (2–3) is enough to
                    stay a step ahead; keeping it low bounds how far ahead links
                    are minted so signed CDN URLs never go stale before use.
    *stop*        - optional cancel event; when set, both stages drain the
                    remainder (feeding *download* with ``links=None``) so every
                    mod is still handed off once and the caller short-circuits.
    *spawn*       - optional ``spawn(target, name) -> thread-like`` for tests.

    The ready queue is bounded to ``dl_workers + link_workers`` so the fetchers
    stay only a step ahead of consumption - enough to keep every download slot
