"""Hair colour for FaceGen head meshes, from the NPC record in a plugin.

Skyrim ships hair textures as GREYSCALE and tints them at runtime, so a
NIF-only preview shows white/grey hair. The colour is not a texture-set
override (see [[txst_lookup]]) but a colour form:

    FaceGeom/<master>/<formid>.nif -> NPC_ record -> HCLF -> CLFM -> CNAM

Skyrim CLFM records store CNAM as RGBA bytes. Fallout 4 hair colours instead
set FNAM's ``Remapping Index`` flag and store a float selecting a row in the
hair shader's gradient texture. Treating that float's bytes as RGB is what
turns ordinary Fallout hair fluorescent yellow.

Only the plugins actually needed are walked - the mod's own, plus the one or
two masters named by the FormIDs - because the masters are large.
