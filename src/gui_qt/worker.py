"""run_in_worker — start a daemon thread that computes a result and hands it
back to the UI thread via a Signal.

The standard pattern in gui_qt is: nested ``worker()`` → ``threading.Thread``
→ ``safe_emit(done_sig, result)``. This helper replaces that scaffold for the
common compute-one-result case; workers that stream progress or emit several
different Signals keep their hand-rolled form.

The emit goes through safe_emit, so a result arriving after the owning view
was closed is dropped instead of raising into the worker thread. Exceptions
from *fn* are written to the app log (visible log panel, thread-safe).
